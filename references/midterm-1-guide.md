The following topics *could* appear on midterm 1.
This list could shrink or expand (which would be announced in class).

**You will be able to bring one hand written single or double sided sheet of notes into the exam**


### 2D coordinate transforms

- understand in general why we use different coordinate systems (world, image and pixel)
- be able to solve for the scale and translate variables of a mapping from one 2D coordinate system to the next, given corner constraints


### Vectors

- understand how to do vector addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, dot product and cross product
- understand how to find the angle between two vectors
- understand the difference between a vector and a point
- understand the relationship of vectors, points and planes


### 3D transforms and matrices

- have a general understanding of matrices and matrix/vector operations
- understand what matrices look like for various 2D and 3D transformations, such as translation, scale, rotate and shear
- be able to apply these transforms
- Write the pseudo-code for the virtual trackball rotations.
- Be able to clearly specify what a composite transform will do to given geometry


### OpenGL/GLSL/glm

- Understand the role of a vertex shader
- Understand the role of a fragment shader
- Understand basic GLSL coding (data passing and computation)
- Understand the basic structure and reasoning for using vertex buffer objects (VBOs) and index buffer objects (IBOs)
- know general OpenGL/GLSL/glm calls for drawing basic primitive types and for applying transformations


### Rasterization

and depth buffer algorithms
