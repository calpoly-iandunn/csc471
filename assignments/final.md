All dates are also on the course schedule.

## Project Description

For the project description, you need to submit a 1-2 paragraph written description of your project.
You will need to include a brief overview of the project and a list of the project’s goals.
Be sure to think about and include information on such topics as:

- what kind of data is necessary for your project (what is the input data type and output data type)

- where you will be getting any data you may need

- what resources/references you will use or may need

- how the user will interact with your program and what you will ultimately display/render.

Please include any references you have already found.
In general, the format of your project description should include:

- Introduction: general description of the project

- Goals: list of what your project will accomplish (this can be a bullet list)
  (you do not need to include a timeline, but I encourage you to think about a timeline and include it if you’d like).

- **Highlight what graphics technology you will either be deepening your knowledge of or expanding your knowledge of.**

- Any references

Feel free to include any figures that will help illustrate your project if relevant.
For ideas for a project, consider looking at all the past class projects or at the SIGGRAPH website for past papers, sketches and courses.

### Hand-In

[Submit your final project description via GitHub Classroom at this link.](https://classroom.github.com/a/dLRmHrl4)

The following formats are acceptable:

- PDF (`.pdf`)
- Markdown (`.md`)
- Plain text (`.txt`)


## Project

You will be doing an in class 5 minute presentation of your project – demonstrating the accomplishments of your project to your peers and the professor.
Please note that you will need to submit the source code, executable, and relevant data related to your final project to Github Classroom before the scheduled final time.

In addition, you will need to submit a webpage documenting your project (include project description, results images, and references on the webpage).
The website will be due by Friday of finals week and will be turned in via Github Classroom.

Your final project can be in one of the following formats:

- `.html` and `.css`
- A [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site that can be deployed to [github-pages](https://pages.github.com/)

Note that if you turn in simply github-flavored markdown files (different from a jekyll site),
I will not be able to render it nicely (it will be unstyled Times New Roman on a white background).
